### 5. Configure a remote for your fork (in vscode)

[https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)

Configure your local fork and tell it where the original code repo is so you can compare and merge updates later when official repo is updated

Check repos

```
git remote -v
```

Add upstream repo

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/wh1te909/tacticalrmm
```

Confirm changes

```
git remote -v
```


### 6. Contribute code

Make changes to something.

`Commit` (update something) and notate what you did

`Push` (from your local vscode to your github fork)

Open browser and look at your repo (It should reflect your commit)


#### 6a. Request your changes to be pulled into the primary repo (Pull Request)

![Changes you've made need integration with master repo](images/trmm_contribute-notice.png)

In browser create pull request

### 7. Sync your local fork

[https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)

Bring changes from original repo to your local vscode copy so you're current with changes made in original Github repo

![Sync Fork](images/trmm_need_sync_local_fork.png)

```
git pull --rebase upstream develop
```
#### 7a. Push your local updated copy to your Github fork

Then you're `push`ing that updated local repo to your online Github fork
