# Installation

## Minimum requirements
- A fresh linux VM running either Ubuntu 20.04 or Debian 10, with a minimum of 2GB RAM.<br/>

!!!warning
    The provided install script assumes a fresh server with no software installed on it. Attempting to run it on an existing server with other services **will** break things and the install will fail.<br/><br/>
    The install script has been tested on the following public cloud providers: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, BuyVM (highly recommended), Hetzner, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, as well as behind NAT on Hyper-V, Proxmox and ESXi.

- A real domain is needed to generate a Let's Encrypt wildcard cert. <br/>If you cannot afford to purchase a domain ($12 a year) then you can get one for free at [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com/)<br/><br/>

- A TOTP based authenticator app. Some popular ones are Google Authenticator, Authy and Microsoft Authenticator.<br/><br/>

## Install

#### Run updates and setup the linux user
SSH into the server as **root**.<br/><br/>
Download and run the prereqs and latest updates<br/>
```bash
apt update
apt install -y wget curl sudo
apt -y upgrade
```
If a new kernel is installed, then reboot the server with the `reboot` command<br/><br/>
Create a linux user named `tactical` to run the rmm and add it to the sudoers group.<br/>

**For Ubuntu**:
```bash
adduser tactical
usermod -a -G sudo tactical
```

**For Debian**:
```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/bash tactical
usermod -a -G sudo tactical
```

#### Setup the firewall (optional but highly recommended)

!!!info
    Skip this step if your VM is __not__ publicly exposed to the world e.g. running behind NAT. You should setup the firewall rules in your router instead (ports 22, 443 and 4222 TCP).

```bash
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow https
ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 4222
```

!!!info
    SSH (port 22 tcp) is only required for you to remotely login and do basic linux server administration for your rmm. It is not needed for any agent communication.<br/>
Allow ssh from everywhere (__not__ recommended)
```bash
ufw allow ssh
```

Allow ssh from only allowed IP's (__highly__ recommended)
```bash
ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22
ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22
```

Enable and activate the firewall
```
ufw enable && ufw reload
```

#### Create the A records

We'll be using `example.com` as our domain for this example.

!!!info
    The RMM uses 3 different sites. The Vue frontend e.g. `rmm.example.com` which is where you'll be accesing your RMM from the browser, the REST backend e.g. `api.example.com` and Meshcentral e.g. `mesh.example.com`


Get the public IP of your server with `curl https://icanhazip.tacticalrmm.io`<br/>
Open the DNS manager of wherever the domain you purchased is hosted.<br/>
Create 3 A records: `rmm`, `api` and `mesh` and point them to the public IP of your server:

#### Run the install script

Switch to the `tactical` user
```bash
su - tactical
```

Download and run the install script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh1te909/tacticalrmm/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Answer the initial questions when prompted. Replace `example.com` with your domain.

#### Deploy the TXT record in your DNS manager:

!!!warning
    TXT records can take anywhere from 1 minute to a few hours to propogate depending on your DNS provider.<br/>
    You should verify the TXT record has been deployed first before pressing Enter.<br/>
    A quick way to check is with the following command:<br/> `dig -t txt _acme-challenge.example.com`

Create a login for the RMM web UI:

![rmmlogin](images/rmmlogin.png)

A bunch of URLS / usernames / passwords will be printed out at the end of the install script. **Save these somewhere safe.** [Recover them if you didn't](faq.md#how-do-i-recover-my-meshcentral-login-credentials)


Copy the url for the meshagent exe (`https://mesh.example.com/agentinvite?c=......`), paste it in your browser and download the mesh agent:

![meshagentdl](images/meshagentdl.png)

Navigate to `https://rmm.example.com` and login with the username/password you created during install.<br/><br/>
Once logged in, you will be redirected to the initial setup page.<br/><br/>
Create your first client/site, choose the default timezone and then upload the mesh agent you just downloaded.
